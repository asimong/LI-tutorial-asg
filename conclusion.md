# Conclusions for this trial

Taking all the points from [[tutorial-1]] and [[tutorial-2]] into account,
I can manage this, just about, but then I'm somewhat familiar with the underlying technology.
My guess is that for people who really aren't familiar, it will either take detailed handholding,
a lot of time, or cause a lot of frustration and generate a negative impression
and an unwillingness to go this way.

So, my vote for the time being is “not yet ready”.

Think Apple-style usability, which is well designed for ordinary people.
This doesn't have it, but it needs it.
* Where you don't need to install extra programs or apps on your device (currently, fail)
* Where the right way of doing things is intuitive (currently, fail):
  * where the software guides you clearly to the way that works;
  * where potential errors are caught and flagged before being;
  * where mistakes are easy to correct (currently, fail).

This is my usability sense based on having been around the usability scene for many years.
As always, it is relatively easy to design a system for “people like me”. 
Most people aren't like me — I can't assume they have my skill set or experience.
That's what usability testing with real representative users is all about!
