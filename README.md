# This is the README for my Life Itself Tutorial called “Make It Markdown”
## Reflections, comments, feedback

This is a great experiment, because depending on how well it works 
I might be tempted to investigate changing my own site from DokuWiki to this setup, which is
- Markdown
- Obsidian
- GitHub
- Flowershow

My [actual home page](https://www.simongrant.org/ ) is done in plain HTML managed with good old FTP,
which works very well, can of course be easily formatted with CSS, but equally is rather cumbersome to edit,
particularly when I want to put in backlinked footnotes etc.

On the other hand, my [DokuWiki site](https://wiki.simongrant.org/ ) is very easy to manage and edit,
even from a smartphone if needed, but naturally doesn't give easy control over formatting and page style.

The reason I'm doing this is mainly to test out Rufus's idea of doing things with MOGF (as above) 
to see how it works.
I'm not against this in principle, but one or two things seem more or less important.
- Full and clear instructions need to be provided. This has already been done pretty well, brilliant!
- A peer support network needs to be started. My idea is to have a tree with a branching factor of about 3–4.
- Make certain there is a clear rescue path should any of the outsourced services go down or start extrating money.
- I would much rather use open source software hosted by coops with servers running on renewable energy.

I hope to go on to creating notes on the tutorial itself. Eat your own dogfood, eh!
