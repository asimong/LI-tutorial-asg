# Tutorial 2 notes
## These relate to the [Make It Markdown Tutorial 2](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/tutorial-2)

Same point as in [[Tutorial-1]] about what the final website will look like.

First point to note â€¦ (BOOOOOO!) is that the [GitHub Desktop site](https://desktop.github.com/) **DOESN'T SUPPORT LINUX**!!!
Come on, now, please!

So I did some searching and found [this thread on GitHub itself](https://gist.github.com/berkorbay/6feda478a00b0432d13f1fc0a50467f1).
The initial instructions at the top don't work anymore, but [down in one of the comments](https://gist.github.com/berkorbay/6feda478a00b0432d13f1fc0a50467f1?permalink_comment_id=4787516#gistcomment-4787516) there is one that actually does work!
