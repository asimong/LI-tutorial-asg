# Tutorial 2 notes
## These relate to the [Make It Markdown Tutorial 2](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/tutorial-2)

My [index is here](https://github.com/asimong/LI-tutorial-asg) (that's the direct github link)
* or with the double-square-bracket link straight to the flowershow version: [[README]]

Note that the double-square-bracket link works in Flowershow, but not in the native GitHub text.
I'd say that is an unfortunately confusing problem, and a serious compromise of usability.

Same point as in [[tutorial-1]] about what the final website will look like.

First point to note â€¦ (BOOOOOO!) is that the [GitHub Desktop site](https://desktop.github.com/) **DOESN'T SUPPORT LINUX**!!!
Come on, now, please!

So I did some searching and found [this thread on GitHub itself](https://gist.github.com/berkorbay/6feda478a00b0432d13f1fc0a50467f1).
The initial instructions at the top don't work anymore, but [down in one of the comments](https://gist.github.com/berkorbay/6feda478a00b0432d13f1fc0a50467f1?permalink_comment_id=4787516#gistcomment-4787516) there is one that actually does work!
