# Tutorial 1 notes
## These relate to the README, introduction, background, and [Make It Markdown Tutorial 1](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/tutorial-1)

I've noticed the [PortalJS tutorial](https://portaljs.org/blog/create-a-website-from-scratch) 
and I'm wondering how much has just been lifted from there.
It's actually quite different in content. 
What they have done well is to put partial screenshots everywhere so that you aren't 
hunting round looking for the thing you're trying to find.
It does however explain the rather mysterious [README page for the guide](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/)
where it says “Tutorial 1: Create a website from scratch using markdown and PortalJS” 
when we are actually talking Flowershow as the thing us learners are interacting with.

The [Introduction](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/introduction)
has a table of contents — not sure whether this is really needed, 
but it could be helpful if you're trying to get back to where you left off.

The [Background and motivation page](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/background)
has some unexpected back-ticks around “# This is a Heading” and “**This text is bold**”.
The rest of this page is generally helpful.
At the end of the page, the link to Next has no space underneath. Some space might help the link to be easily seen.

So, on to [Tutorial 1 itself](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/tutorial-1).
Near the top it says
> Below is a screenshot of how the final website will look like:

I'd say this is a little misleading, as what the final site looks like will depend on what is entered,
and the instructions don't explicitly tell you to enter that (complete with some “Lorem ipsum” text).
How about saying that it will depend on what you enter?

I managed the “Setting up a website” part fine. It's quite involved, but manageable.
Likewise with the “Editing a page on your website”.
