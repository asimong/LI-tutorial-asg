# Tutorial 1 notes
## These relate to the README, introduction, background, and [Make It Markdown Tutorial 1](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/tutorial-1)

I've noticed the [PortalJS tutorial](https://portaljs.org/blog/create-a-website-from-scratch) 
and I'm wondering how much has just been lifted from there.
It's actually quite different in content. 
What they have done well is to put partial screenshots everywhere so that you aren't 
hunting round looking for the thing you're trying to find.
It does however explain the rather mysterious [README page for the guide](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/)
where it says “Tutorial 1: Create a website from scratch using markdown and PortalJS” 
when we are actually talking Flowershow as the thing us learners are interacting with.

The [Introduction](https://makeitmarkdown.flowershow.app/learn/introduction)
has a table of contents — not sure whether this is really needed, 
but it could be helpful if you're trying to get back to where you left off.
